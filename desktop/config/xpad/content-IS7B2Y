Find broken symlinks and delete them

If you don't want to delete them, but just want to list them, do
find -L /path -type l

If you want to delete them with confirmation first, do
find -L /path -type l -exec rm -i {} +

Using the -L flag follows symlinks, so the -type l test only returns true if the link can't be followed, or is a symlink to another broken symlink.
